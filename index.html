            <!--Bio-->

            <div class="bio">
                I love board games. I play a lot of different ones, but the ones we keep coming back to week after weeks
                are
                Aeon's End, Pandemic, and Betrayal at House on the Hill. I really like having a story in the games; so,
                personally, I really like the Legacy style of games. However, my favorite game is Mice and Mystics.

                I also love video games. Currently, I play Apex Legends, but I also play Assassin's Creed:
                Origins. I used to love playing competitive games, but, as I've gotten older and a
                family, I don't have as much time to play any more. As such, the younger generation seems to
                be passing me by; thus, making me love story driven or cooperative games more.

                My final favorite hobby is sports. I love playing sports, I love watching sports, I love talking sports,
                and
                if it's sports related, I probably love that, too. All time favorite sport to play is soccer. Though, I
                really enjoyed hockey as well, I wasn't very good. My favorite sport to watch is football, closely
                followed
                by hockey and soccer. My favorite teams are the Dallas Cowboys, the Dallas Stars, and Arsenal. Due to my
                daughter's interest, I'm starting to grow my interest in basketball and the Dallas Mavericks, again.
